# Why Build Progressive Web Apps {: .page-title }

The hardest problem with software is distribution. App developers often
spend more on distribution than they earn back. This problem is solved by
the web platform, however web apps have historically been less capable
than native apps. With the advent of PWAâ€™s, web apps have become just as
capable as native, supporting features such as push notifications and
Add to Homescreen, without giving up the reach of the web.
